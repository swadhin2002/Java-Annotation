Spring Web Annotations:
-----------------------
41. @RequestMapping: Maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers.

48. @PathVariable: Binds a URI template variable to a method parameter.
49. @RequestBody: Binds the body of a web request to a method parameter.
50. @ResponseBody: Indicates that a method's return value should be bound to the web response body.
51. @ModelAttribute: Binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute.
52. @SessionAttributes: Indicates the names of session attributes to store in a session.
53. @RequestHeader: Binds a web request header to a method parameter.
54. @CookieValue: Binds a cookie value to a method parameter.
55. @CrossOrigin: Enables cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for controller methods.
56. @ExceptionHandler: Defines a method to handle exceptions thrown by controller methods.
57. @RestControllerAdvice: Combines `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ResponseBody` to handle exceptions across RESTful services.
58. @ControllerAdvice: Allows global handling of exceptions, data binding, etc., across multiple controllers.

Spring AOP Annotations:
-----------------------
59. @Aspect: Marks a class as an aspect (a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes).
60. @Before: Executes an advice before a method execution.
61. @After: Executes an advice after a method execution.
62. @AfterReturning: Executes an advice after a method successfully returns a result.
63. @AfterThrowing: Executes an advice after a method throws an exception.
64. @Around: Surrounds a method execution with custom behavior.
65. @Pointcut: Declares a reusable pointcut expression.
66. @EnableAspectJAutoProxy: Enables support for handling components marked with `@Aspect`.

Spring Integration and Event Annotations:
-----------------------------------------
67. @EventListener: Marks a method as an event listener, handling specific events.
68. @EnableScheduling: Enables Spring's scheduled task execution capability.
69. @Scheduled: Marks a method to be scheduled to run at fixed intervals or cron expressions.
